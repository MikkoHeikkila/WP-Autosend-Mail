# WP-Autosend-Mail
Wordpress plugin that mails a custom php/html file to a list of emails.

I have had to make some sort of automatic newsletter for multiple projects now. The messsage changes with each project, but the general functionality is always the same. I haven't been able to find a plugin that did exactly what I wanted, or made customizing it easy. So my hope is that this will save a lot of time for developers who want to make something similar.

<b>Coding required for customizing the actual message that you want to send.</b> So this won't work right out of the box. But hopefully this is exactly what you want.

Any and all help/criticism is much appreciated :)
